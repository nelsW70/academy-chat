              John and Jean will task you with something and walk away because
              that’s realistic sometimes and you need to learn to cope with

              Developers copy and paste code way more than you probably think
              they do. Most people are not writing things from scratch because
              there’s no sense reinventing the wheel.

              <br />
              You just have to understand how/why the wheel works.

              If you spend a lot of time making something work chances are
              you'll exert a fraction of the energy the next time you do it

              There’s a concept called creature memory where information is
              transferred through dna to increase the chances of survival.
              Species are born possessing certain knowledge relevant to their
              survival.

              Don’t expect coding to work like that. Human babies don't know
              what the fuck a for loop is. You’ll learn what you need as you
              need it.
